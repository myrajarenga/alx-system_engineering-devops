Taks
0. Change your Home IP
Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this
In this example we can see that:

before running the script, localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 and facebook.com resolves to 157.240.11.35
after running the script, localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2 and facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8
If you’re running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use, be sure to revert localhost to 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, a lot of things will stop working!
1. Show attached IPs
Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it’s executed on.
2. Port listening on localhost
Write a Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
Terminal #0
stating my script
Terminal #1
Connecting to localhost on port 98 using telnet and typing some text
Terminal #0
Receiving the text on the other side.
For the sake of the exercise, this connection is made entirely within localhost. This isn’t really exciting as is, but we can use this script across networks as well. Try running it between your local PC and your remote server for fun!

As you can see, this can come in very handy in a multitude of situations. Maybe you’re debugging socket connection issues, or you’re trying to connect to a software and you are unsure if the issue is the software or the network, or you’re working on firewall rules… Another tool to add to your debugging toolbox!
