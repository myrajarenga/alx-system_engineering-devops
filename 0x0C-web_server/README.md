	WEB SERVER

Tasks
0. Transfer files to as erver
Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:

Requirements:

Accepts 4 parameters
The path to the file to be transferred
The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
The username scp connects with
The path to the SSH private key that scp uses
Display Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY if less than 3 parameters passed
scp must transfer the file to the user home directory ~/
Strict host key checking must be disabled when using scp

remotely execute the ls ~/ command via ssh to see what ~/ contains
create a file named some_page.html
execute my 0-transfer_file script
remotely execute the ls ~/ command via ssh to see that the file some_page.html has been successfully transferred

1.  Install nginx web server
Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx

In this example 34.198.248.145 is the IP of my web-01 server. If you want to query the Nginx that is locally installed on your server, you can use curl 127.0.0.1.

If things are not going as expected, make sure to check out Nginx logs, they can be found in /var/log/.

2. Setup a domain name
Provide the domain name in your answer file.

Requirement:

provide the domain name only (example: foobar.tech), no subdomain (example: www.foobar.tech)
configure your DNS records with an A entry so that your root domain points to your web-01 IP address Warning: the propagation of your records can take time (~1-2 hours)
go to your profile and enter your domain in the Project website url field

When your domain name is setup, please verify the Registrar here: https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/ and you must see in the JSON response: "registrarName": "Dotserve Inc"

3. Redirection 
Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.

Requirements:

The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Using what you did with 1-install_nginx_web_server, write 3-redirection so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

4.  Not found page 404
Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.

Requirements:

The page must return an HTTP 404 error code
The page must contain the string Ceci n'est pas une page
Using what you did with 3-redirection, write 4-not_found_page_404 so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task

5. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)
Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, we’d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.

Requirements:

Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
